# AndroMalPack-Dataset
AndroMalPack data set contains cryptographic hashes of repacked Android malware apps in three benchmark Android malware datasets (Drebin, AMD and Androzoo) based on package name reusing.
AndroMalPack dataset consists of three .csv file where each file contains hashes of repacked malware apps in Drebin, AMD and Androzoo datasets. Since, Drebin, AMD and Androzoo datasets is restricted to unauthorized access, we do not provide the APK files of the repacked malware. Subsequently, the hashes provided in the AndroMalPack dataset can be employed to filter repacked APKs (based on package names reusing) from the Drebin, AMD and Androzoo datasets. Each .csv file contains two columns where the first column consists of cryptographic hash whereas the second column contains the corresponding package names of the APK. Drebin and Androzoo datasets label each app with SHA256 hash whereas AMD dataset labels apps by using MD5 hashes. Likewise, AndroMalPack dataset use SHA256 hashes for Drebin and Androzoo whereas MD5 hashes for AMD dataset to represent repackaged apps based on package name reusing.
